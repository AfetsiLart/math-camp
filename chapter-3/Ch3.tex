\subsection{The Area Problem}\label{the-area-problem}}

Suppose that we have a (inverse) demand function such as \(p = f(q)\)
relating price \((p)\) and quantity \((q)\) of a commodity. Let us
assume that the commodity is something like a house or a car, so that
consumers will only buy one unit of \(Q\). We can think of the demand
function \(q = f^{-1}(p)\) as counting how many consumers have
reservation price larger than or equal to \(p\). Figure
ref\{area\_under\_curve\} shows the graph of the inverse demand
function.

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{Ch3_files/Ch3_3_0.pdf}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    To compute the consumer's total willingness to pay for \(Q\), let's
assume that the producers of \(Q\) sell it in small lots
\(\Delta q = q_{n} - q_{n-1}\) with \(q_n = n\Delta q\) for any
\(n = 1,2,\ldots,N\). By selling at price \(p_1\) the producer can sell
the first lot, and consumer expenditure will be equal to
\(q_1 \cdot p_1 = (q_1-0)\cdot f(q_1)\). The second lot would be sold at
a price of \(p_2\) and thus, now total consumer expenditure would be
equal to \(f(q_1)(q_1 - 0) + f(q_2)(q_2 - q_1)\) which is the area of
the two first rectangles in Figure ref\{area\_under\_curve\}. This can
go on at each step, at the end, total consumer expenditure is

\[
\sum^N_{n=1} f(q_n)(q_n - q_{n-1})
\]

This is the \textbf{Riemann sum} of the inverse demand function in
Figure ref\{area\_under\_curve\}. However, notice that we have made the
assumption that producers can only sell in \emph{small lots}. In the
actual market, only \(q^*\) units will be sold at a price \(p^*\) and
thus, the area under the curve from \(q = 0\) up to \(q = q^*\) is
sometimes called the \textbf{total willingness to pay} for \(q^*\)
units. Total willingness to pay minus actual expenditure (in
equilibrium, actual expenditure is \(q^* f(q^*)\)) is called the
\textbf{consumer surplus}.

If instead we would assume that the commodity is well approximated by a
continuous variable \(q\) (e.g.~massages, and \emph{producers} sell
whatever amount of time of massage) this process of adding up the areas
of the rectangles would be missing the little white spaces in between
the curve and the rectangles. One of the possibilities is to make the
rectangles thinner and thinner but this will only give us an
approximation or some bounds for this area. If we could make the width
of the rectangles infinitesimally small and then we could compute the
sum, then it would no longer be an approximation but the actual value of
the area under the curve. Formally, the area under the inverse demand
curve is given by

\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \sum^n_{i=1} f(q_i)(q_i-q_{i-1})
\]

We are at a point where we can define the \textbf{definite integral}.

\textbf{Definition:} If \(f\) is a function defined for
\(a\leq x \leq b\), we divide the interval \([a,b]\) into \(n\)
subintervals of equal width \(\Delta x = (b-a)/n\). Letting \(x_0 = a\)
and \(x_n = b\) be the initial and ending points of the interval, and
\(x_i^*\) for \(i=1,2,\ldots,n\) be any points inside these
subintervals, so that \(x_i^*\in[x_{i-1},x_i]\). Then, the
\textbf{definite} integral of \(f\) from \(a\) to \(b\) is

\[
\int^b_a f(x) dx = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)\Delta x
\]

provided that this limit exists. If it does exist, we say \(f\) is
\textbf{integrable} on \([a,b]\).

\textbf{Remark:} The precise meaning of this limit is that
\(\forall\varepsilon > 0 \ \exists N\in\mathbb{Z} \ : \\) \[
    \Bigg\lvert \int^b_a f(x) dx - \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)\Delta x \Bigg\rvert
    \]

\(\forall n > N\) and for every choice of \(x_i^*\in[x_{i-1}, x_i]\)

\textbf{Remark:} An important assumption we have made is that we are
talking about \textbf{positive} functions, which makes sense for demand
functions since we only care about positive quantities of goods.
However, if we had a function that would take positive and negative
values, then the Riemann sum would correspond to the sum of the areas of
the rectangles that lie above the \(x-\)axis and the negatives of the
areas of the rectangles that lie below the \(x-\)axis.

An issue that we have not talked about yet is whether the limit that
defines the definite integral exists or not and under which conditions.
We state an important theorem about this.

\textbf{Theorem:} If \(f\) is a continuous function on \([a,b]\), or if
\(f\) has only a finite number of jump discontinuities, then \(f\) is
integrable on \([a,b]\); i.e., the definite integral
\(\int^b_a f(x) dx\) exists.

\textbf{Example:} Evaluate the Riemann sum for \(f(x) = x^3 - 6x\) in
\([0,3]\) with \(6\) intervals.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Interval width is given by \(\Delta x = (3-0)/ 6 = 1/2\)
\item
  Let's take the right-end points as our \(x_i\). That is the points
  \(\{0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3\}\)
\item
  The Riemann sum is then:
\end{enumerate}

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\$f( 0.50) = -2.875 \$
\$f( 1.00) = -5.000 \$
\$f( 1.50) = -5.625 \$
\$f( 2.00) = -4.000 \$
\$f( 2.50) =  0.625 \$
\$f( 3.00) =  9.000 \$
\$\textbackslash{}sum\^{}6\_\{i=1\} f(x\_i)\textbackslash{}Delta x = \textbackslash{}Delta x \textbackslash{}sum\^{}6\_\{i=1\}f(x\_i) = -3.9375
\end{Verbatim}

    \textbf{Example:} Evaluate now \(\displaystyle\int^3_0 (x^3-6x) dx\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Note first that with \(n\) subintervals, \(\Delta x = 3/n\).
\item
  The lower bound of the interval is \(0\), thus
  \(x_0 = 0, x_1 = 3/n, x_2 = 6/n,\ldots, x_i = (3i)/n\).
\item
  Now we can use these as our sample points.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{align*}
\int^3_0 (x^3-6x) dx &= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sum^n_{i=1} f(x_i) \Delta x \\
&= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \sum^n_{i=1} f\left(\frac{3i}{n}\right) \frac{3}{n} \\
&= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{3}{n} \sum^n_{i=1} \left[\left(\frac{3i}{n}\right)^3 - 6\left(\frac{3i}{n}\right)\right] \\
&= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{3}{n} \sum^n_{i=1} \left[ \frac{27i^3}{n^3} - \frac{18 i}{n} \right] \\
&= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \left[\frac{81}{n^4} \sum^n_{i=1} \left(i^3\right) - \frac{54}{n^2} \sum^n_{i=1} \left(i\right)\right] \\
&= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \left[\frac{81}{n^4} \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{54}{n^2} \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)\right] \\
&= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \left[\frac{81}{4} \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{n^2}\right)^2 - 27\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{n^2}\right)\right] \\
&= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \left[\frac{81}{4} \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 - 27\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)\right] \\
&= \frac{81}{4} - 27 = \frac{-27}{4} = -6.75
\end{align*}

The results are strikingly different, since \(n = 6\) is a poor
approximation for the Riemann sum to equal the definite integral. Note
further, this cannot be interpreted as an area since the function takes
on negative values. Figure ref\{riemann\_vs\_actual\} shows why \(n=6\)
yields a poor result.

\subsection{The Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus}\label{the-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus}}

This theorem is so important (fundamental) because it stablishes the
connection between two branches of calculus, differential and integral
calculus. Isaac Barrow (Newton's mentor) discovered how the area problem
and the tangent problem are related, in fact, he discovered that
integration and differentiation are inverse processes. Before getting
into the theorem itself, let us start by giving some definitions.

\textbf{Definition:} Given a function \(f(x)\) it is called a
\textbf{primitive} (or \textbf{indefinite integral}) to another function
\(F(x)\) such that

\[
F'(x) = f(x)
\]

\textbf{Example:} Take \(f(x) = 2x\). Then: 1. \(F(x) = x^2 - \pi\) is a
primitive. 1. \(F(x) = x^2 + 2\) is a primitive. 1. \(F(x) = x^2 - 73\)
is a primitive. 1. \(F(x) = x^2 + \mathcal{C}\) is a primitive
\(\forall C\in\mathbb{R}\)

Therefore, two primitives of a function differ \textbf{only} by a
constant. Let \(F(x)\) and \(G(x)\) be two primitives of a function
\(f(x)\), then

\[
F'(x) = G'(x) = f(x) \ \Rightarrow \ \left(F(x)-G(x)\right)' = 0 \ \Rightarrow \ F(x) - G(x) = \mathcal{C}
\]

The set of all primitives of a function \(f(x)\) is denoted by
\(\displaystyle\int f(x) dx\).

\begin{quote}
\textbf{IMPORTANT:} It is very important to notice that a definite
integral is a \textbf{number} while an indefinite integral is a
\textbf{family of functions}. They are \textbf{not} the same thing.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Immediate Primitives:} These are directly obtained from the
differentiation rules.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\displaystyle \int x^r \: dx = \dfrac{x^{r+1}}{r+1} + \mathcal{C}, \quad r \neq -1\)
\item
  \$\displaystyle \int x\^{}\{-1\} : dx =
  \displaystyle \int \dfrac{1}{x} : dx = \ln(x) + \mathcal{C} \$
\item
  \(\displaystyle \int e^x \: dx = e^x + \mathcal{C}\)
\item
  \(\displaystyle \int \cos(x) \: dx = \sin(x) + \mathcal{C}\)
\item
  \(\displaystyle \int \sin(x) \: dx = -\cos(x) + \mathcal{C}\)
\item
  \$ \displaystyle \int \dfrac{1}{1+x^2} : dx = \arctan(x) + \mathcal{C}
  \$
\end{itemize}

    \hypertarget{properties-of-integrals}{%
\subsubsection{Properties of Integrals}\label{properties-of-integrals}}

\hypertarget{linearity}{%
\paragraph{Linearity}\label{linearity}}

We know that the derivative of the sum of two functions is the sum of
the derivatives and that the derivative of a constant multiplied by a
function is just the constant multiplied by the derivative of the
function. These linearity properties carry over to the process of
integration.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\int k f(x) dx = k \int f(x) dx\)
\item
  \(\int (f(x) + g(x)) dx = \int f(x) dx + \int g(x) dx\)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{substitution}{%
\paragraph{Substitution}\label{substitution}}

This property is based on the derivative of a composite function, that
is, suppose we have \(f(x) = \log(\sin(x))\), letting \(z = \sin(x)\)
the derivative of \(f(z)\) is given by

\[
f'(z) = \frac{dz}{z} = \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}
\]

Using the same argument in integration, if

\[
\int f(x) dx = F(x) \Rightarrow \int f(z) dz = F(z)
\]

Basically, \emph{we do not care about the name of the variable} to
obtain the primitive of the function.

\textbf{Example:} Integrate: -
\(\int 2 e^{2x} dx = \int e^{2x}d(2x) = \int e^z dz = e^z + \mathcal{C} = e^{2x} + \mathcal{C}\)

\textbf{Some other Immediate Primitives:} -
\(\displaystyle \int [f(x)]^r f'(x) \: dx = \dfrac{[f(x)]^{r+1}}{r+1} + \mathcal{C}, \quad r \neq -1\)
- \$\displaystyle  \int \dfrac{f'(x)}{f(x)} : dx = \ln(f(x)) +
\mathcal{C} \$ -
\(\displaystyle \int f'(x) e^{f(x)} \: dx = e^{f(x)} + \mathcal{C}\) -
\(\displaystyle \int \cos(f(x))f'(x) \: dx = \sin(f(x)) + \mathcal{C}\)
-
\(\displaystyle \int \sin(f(x)) f'(x) \: dx = -\cos(f(x)) + \mathcal{C}\)
- \$\displaystyle \int \dfrac{f'(x)}{1+[f(x)]^2} : dx = \arctan(f(x)) +
\mathcal{C} \$

\subsubsection{The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Part
I}\label{the-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus.-part-i}}

Before stating and proving Part I of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, let us state and prove one important property of integrals.

\textbf{Property:label\{bounds\}} If \(m\leq f(x) \leq M\) for
\(a\leq x \leq b\), then:

\[
m(b-a) \leq \int^b_a f(x) dx \leq M(b-a) 
\]

\textbf{Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part I):} If \(f\) is
continuous on \([a,b]\), then the function \(g\) defined by

\[
g(x) = \int^x_a f(t) dt
\]

for \(a\leq x \leq b\) is continuous on \([a,b]\) and differentiable on
\((a,b)\), and \(g'(x) = f(x)\)

\emph{Proof:} If \(x\) and \(x+h\) are in \((a,b)\) then:

\begin{align}
g(x+h) - g(x) &= \int^{x+h}_a f(t) dt - \int^x_a f(t) dt \\
&= \left(\int_a^x f(t) dt + \int_x^{x+h} f(t)dt\right) - \int^x_a f(t) dt \\
&= \int_x^{x+h} f(t)dt \\
\end{align}

And so, for \(h\neq 0\):

\[
\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h} = \frac{1}{h}\int_x^{x+h} f(t) dt
\]

Let us assume that \(h>0\) by now. Since \(f(x)\) is continuous on
\([x,x+h]\), Weierstrass' Theorem tells us that there are two numbers
\(u,v\in[x,x+h]\) such that \(f(u) = m\) and \(f(v) = M\) where \(m\)
and \(M\) are the absolute minimum and maximum values of \(f\) on
\([x,x+h]\). By Property ref\{bounds\}, we have

\[
mh \leq \int^{x+h}_x f(t) dt \leq Mh
\]

\[
f(u)h \leq \int^{x+h}_x f(t) dt \leq f(v) h
\]

Since \(h>0\) we can divide by \(h\):

\[
f(u) \leq \frac{1}{h}\int^{x+h}_{x}f(t) dt \leq f(v)
\]

Replacing Equation eqref\{eqn:important\_eqn\_FTC1\}:

\[
f(u) \leq \frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h} \leq f(v)
\]

Let now \(h\rightarrow 0\). Then, both \(u\) and \(v\) tend to \(x\)
since they are inside \([x,x+h]\). Therefore:

\begin{align}
\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} f(u) = \lim_{u\rightarrow x} f(u) = f(x) \\
\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} f(v) = \lim_{v\rightarrow x} f(v) = f(x) \\
\end{align}

Then, using the last inequality from before:

\begin{equation}
g'(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h} = f(x)
\end{equation}

If \(x = a\) or \(x = b\), then equation eqref\{FTC\_proof\} is
interpreted as a one-side limit. Since \(g(x)\) is differentiable on
\([a,b]\) then \(g(x)\) is continuous on \([a,b]\).

    \textbf{Example:} Let us use an example where we can use the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus. 1. Draw the graph of the function
\(f(x) = \cos(x^2)\) in the rectangle \([0, 2]\times[-1.25, 1.25]\). 2.
Define now \[
g(x) = \int^x_0 \cos(t^2) dt
\] \(g(x)\) is now the area under the graph of \(f(x)\) up to the point
where it becomes a difference of areas (when \(f(x)<0\)). 3. Use
\(g(x)\) to estimate the areas by computing
\(g(0.2), g(0.4),\ldots,g(1.8),g(2)\) 4. The graph of \(g'(x)\) would be
now \(f(x)\), we can infer the graph of \(g'(x)\) from the definition of
the derivative (the slope of a tangent line).

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\$g(0.00) = 0.00
\$g(0.20) = 0.20
\$g(0.40) = 0.40
\$g(0.60) = 0.59
\$g(0.80) = 0.77
\$g(1.00) = 0.90
\$g(1.20) = 0.97
\$g(1.40) = 0.95
\$g(1.60) = 0.83
\$g(1.80) = 0.64
\$g(2.00) = 0.46
\end{Verbatim}

    \begin{quote}
Just by computing g(x) we can see that for some \(x\in[1.20, 1.40]\)
\(f(x)\) will become zero, and afterwards, negative since \(g(x)\) has
declined. Furthermore, we observe that from \(x = 0\) up to \(x = 0.6\)
\(g(x)\) increases the same amount and \(g(x)\) is increasing up to
\(x = 1.20\). This tells us that the function is approximately constant
for \(x\in[0,0.6]\) and \(f(x) > 0\) for \textbf{at least} those
\(x\in[0, 1.20]\). We know that for \(x > 1.20\) the function becomes
negative.

So far, we have seen: - The definite integral is related to the area
problem. - The indefinite integral is the inverse operation of
differentiation and thus it is related to the tangent problem. -
Properties of integrals (linearity, substitution\ldots{}) - Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus Part I: If \(f\) is a continuous function on an
interval, the function \(g(x) = \int^x_a f(t) dt\) is a primitive of
\(f(x)\) and thus, \(g'(x) = f(x)\).

The second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is going to give
us a way of computing definite integrals by using primitives.

\textbf{Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part II):} If \(f\) is
continuous on \([a,b]\), then

\[
\int^b_a f(x) dx = F(b) -  F(a)
\]

where \(F\) is any primitive of \(f\).

\emph{Proof:} We know from FTC Part 1 that if
\(g(x) = \int^x_a f(t) dt\) then, \(g'(x) = f(x)\); that is, \(g(x)\) is
a primitive of \(f(x)\). Suppose now that \(F\) is any other primitive
of \(f\), then \(F(x) = g(x) + \mathcal{C}\), i.e., \(F\) and \(g\)
differ only by a constant.

Computing now \(g(a)\):

\[
g(a) = \int^a_a f(x) dx = 0
\]

Then:

\begin{align}
F(b) - F(a) & = \left(g(b)+\mathcal{C}\right) - \left(g(a)+\mathcal{C}\right)  \ & \ & \ \\
& = g(b) - g(a) = g(b) \ & \ & \  \\ \\
& = \int^b_a f(x) dx \ & \ & \ \text{by the definition of $g(x)$} \\
\end{align}

\begin{quote}
The second part of the FTC tells us that we can compute the
\textbf{exact} value of the integral \(\int^b_a f(x) dx\) if we know the
value of a primitive at the two extremes of integration.

are going to sketch a model of economic growth in terms of differential
equations. The idea of the model goes back to Thomas Malthus and his
hypothesis is that population and standards of living have been mostly
constant throughout history because most of this time we had
\emph{agricultural societies}. If we suppose that output is produced
using land and labor only and land is fixed, labor grows with births and
declines with deaths but each additional worker increases production by
less and less (diminishing returns). Since land is fixed, there is less
and less land to work on for each of these additional workers. How does
population increase? Population increases when people eat better and
there are better health conditions, thus, population growth is a
function of output per capita. But when population grows, there is less
land to work on, thus the increase in output is not sufficient to
sustain the additional population, thus population declines. This tends
to a constant population and output per capita.

Figure ref\{fig:gdppc\_uk\} shows GDP per capita in the United Kingdom
since 1270. We observe it is mostly flat.

\subsubsection{The Simplest Malthusian Model of
Growth}\label{the-simplest-malthusian-model-of-growth}}

Suppose that output is produced using only land and labor as explained
before, there is no technological progress and population grows as long
as a minimum subsistence level of consumption is assured. Furthermore,
land is fixed. The technology to produce output is given by

\[
Y = B X^{\beta}L^{1-\beta} \ ; \ 0 < \beta < 1
\]

Where \(Y\) is output, \(B\) is technological level (suppose this could
change across countries but not \emph{within} countries), \(X\) is the
stock of land (which is fixed), and \(L\) is labor. Income per capita is
thus given by

\[
y \equiv \frac{Y}{L} = B\left(\frac{X}{L}\right)^{\beta}
\]

Note that as population grows, aggregate output grows but output
\emph{per capita} falls. This is due to the diminishing returns to
labor. More people try to work on the same stock of land available, thus
there is a smaller piece of land for each additional worker.

Now, we define population growth as a function of output per capita, if
output per capita rises, so does population. However, to have an
increasing population, the economy must produce at least some
subsistence term denoted \(\bar{c}\). Mathematically,

\[
\frac{\dot{L}}{L} = \theta\left(y - \bar{c}\right)
\]

Note that population growth can be negative, and it is likely that it
will be negative since to increase we need to fulfill the subsistence
requirement. Substituting the expression for output per capita:

\[
\frac{\dot{L}}{L} = \theta\left(B\left(\frac{X}{L}\right)^{\beta} - \bar{c}\right)
\]

This equation shows that population growth is inversely releated to
population level. The larger it is population now, the lower will be its
growth. This implies that when population levels are low, people is
relatively rich, while for large populations, people tend to be poorer.
This function is shown in Figure ref\{fig:malthus\_phase\}

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.9\paperheight}}{Ch3_files/Ch3_28_0.pdf}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    Furthermore, the dynamics of this system ensure that the economy will
always end up at \(L^*\) regardless of the starting point, as Figure
ref\{fig:malthus\_converge\} shows.

But, how can we actually use integrals to solve this differential
equation? This example is a bit more complicated, let us simplify the
model so that output is produced only using labor, \(Y = B L\), thus,
output per capita is \(y = \frac{Y}{L}\) and therefore,

\[
\frac{\dot{L}}{L} = \theta\left(B - \bar{c}\right)
\]

To solve this differential equation, we can rewrite it so that

\[
\frac{dL}{dt} = \theta BL - \theta \bar{c} L = \theta L\left(B-\bar{c}\right)
\]

Since it is a separable equation, we divide on both sides by
\(\theta L\left(B-\bar{c}\right)\) and integrate with respect to time
\((t)\) to get the solution

\begin{align}
\int \frac{\frac{dL}{dt}}{\theta\left(B-\bar{c}\right)L(t)} dt & = \int 1 dt \\
&= \int\frac{1}{\theta\left(B-\bar{c}\right)L(t)} = t + \mathcal{C} \\
&= \frac{\ln(L(t))}{\theta\left(B-\bar{c}\right)} = t + \mathcal{C} \\
&= L(t) = e^{\theta\left(B-\bar{c}\right)\left(t+\mathcal{C}\right)}
\end{align}

The general solution of this differential equation depends on an
arbitrary constant that will be determined depending on the initial
condition of population level. Suppose \(L(0) = L_0\). Then, by
substituting \(t = 0\) in the general solution and setting it equal to
\(L_0\), we get that

\[
\mathcal{C} = \frac{\ln\left(L_0\right)}{\theta\left(B-\bar{c}\right)}
\]

\begin{quote}
Can you tell whether this simplified economy is, in fact, Malthusian?
\end{quote}

    Let us now solve the initial model. We start with the same steps as
before by expressing the differential equation as

\[
\frac{dL}{dt} = \theta X^{\beta}L^{1-\beta} - \theta\bar{c}L
\]

It is again a separable equation, thus

\begin{align}
\int \frac{\frac{dL}{dt}}{\theta X^{\beta}L^{1-\beta} - \theta\bar{c}L} dt &= \int 1 dt = t+\mathcal{C} & \ & \\
&= \int \frac{1}{\theta X^{\beta}L^{1-\beta} - \theta\bar{c}L} dL & \ & \\
&= \int \frac{L^{\beta-1}}{\theta X^{\beta} - \theta\bar{c}L^{\beta}} dL & \ & \text{(by multiplying and dividing by $L^{\beta-1}$)}
\end{align}

It is convenient now to make a \textbf{change of variables}. Recall that
when solving an integral we \emph{do not care about the name of the
variable}, thus, let \(u = \theta X^{\beta} - \theta\bar{c}L^{\beta}\)
and \(du = -\beta\theta\bar{c}L^{\beta-1}dL\). Therefore, we can solve
the simpler integral

\[
-\frac{1}{\beta\theta\bar{c}}\int\frac{1}{u} du = -\frac{1}{\beta\theta\bar{c}}\ln(u) = -\frac{\ln\left(\theta X^{\beta} -\theta\bar{c}L^{\beta}\right)}{\beta\theta\bar{c}} = t+\mathcal{C}
\]

By exponentiating on both sides and solving for \(L(t)\) we get that the
general solution of this differential equation is given by

\[
L(t) = \left[\frac{\theta X^{\beta} - exp\{-\beta\theta\bar{c}(t+\mathcal{C})\}}{\theta\bar{c}}\right]^{\frac{1}{\beta}}
\]

    \hypertarget{direction-fields}{%
\subsection{Direction Fields}\label{direction-fields}}

Sometimes, we cannot find an explicit solution for a differential
equation, however, there are ways to learn about the equation itself
without obtaining the explicit solution of the equation. One way is to
sketch its graph.

Suppose we have the following problem which is a \textbf{very} common
type of problem in economics and it is called Initial Value Problem.

\[
y'(x) = x + y(x)
\]

This equation is telling us that the slope at any point \((x,y)\) on the
graph (the solution curve) is the sum of the coordinates of the point.
In particular, since the curve passes through \((0,1)\) its slope must
be \(0 + 1 = 1\). Thus, around the point \((0,1)\), the solution is a
short line with slope \(1\). To sketch the solution of the differential
equation, we can plot short segments in certain points \((x_n,y_n)\)
with slope \(x_n + y_n\). This will help with the visualization of the
general shape of the solution curves by indicating the direction at each
point. Figure ref\{fig:direction\_field\} shows the direction field and
the solution of the differential equation.

    \begin{center}

    \hypertarget{eulers-method}{%
\subsection{Euler's Method}\label{eulers-method}}

The basic idea behind direction fields can be used to find numerical
approximations to solutions of differential equations. Take previous
example, since we know the slope at the initial condition we can
approximate the solution as \(L(x) = x + 1\), basically a tangent line
at \((0, 1)\). Euler's method consists on improving this approximation
bit by bit and changing the direction of the slope as the direction
field tells us.

So, the rough steps could be 1. Use the solution \(L(x) = x + 1\) but
stop at \(x = 0.5\) (this is the \textbf{step size}). At this point,
\(L(0.5) = 1.5\). 2. Take \((0.5, 1.5)\) as the starting point for a new
line segment. The slope for this segment is \(y'(0.5) = 0.5 + 1.5 = 2\).
Recall the definition of the slope of a line
\(m = \frac{y - y_0}{x - x_0}\), then the solution for \(x\in[0.5,1]\)
is given by \[
y = 1.5 + 2*(x-0.5) = 2x + 0.5
\] 3. Iterate further taking now another initial point. In this case,
\(x = 1\). If \(x = 1\), then \(y(x) = 2x +0.5 =2.5\). And the new slope
is \(y'(1) = 1 + 2.5 = 3.5\).

The key is that the smaller we make the \textbf{step size} the closer to
the true solution that we will be. If we take an infinitesimal step
size, we would be computing the slope of the solution curve for each
point of the domain, and thus, computing the true solution. Obviously,
this procedure by hand is tedious and very inefficient but computers are
suited for that.

We now discuss how to solve Solow's growth model using Euler's method.
To recall, Solow's growth model consists of two main equations, a
capital accumulation law of motion and a production function.

\textbf{Sketch of Solow's Growth Model:} - Total output in the economy
\((Y)\) is produced using technology, capital, and labor. Technology is
fixed and labor grows at a constant rate \(n\). The production function
is \(Y = AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}\). - An exogenous fraction \(s\) of
output is dedicated to investment and capital depreciates at constant
rate \(\delta\). Capital accumulates according to: \[
\dot{K} = sY - \delta K
\]

Expressing the model in terms of the capital-labor ratio \(k\), the
equilibrium of the economy is given by the solution to the differential
equation

\[
\dot{k} = sAk^{\alpha} - (\delta + n)k
\]

So, to solve the model, with given set of parameters
\(\{A,\alpha,s,\delta,n\}\) and an initial condition \(k(0)\) we have to
find the solution to previous equation. The solution is a point in which
the capital-labor ratio stops growing (i.e.~the steady state). Suppose
an economy starts below its steady state and it takes about 60 years to
get to it. Apart from the parameters of the model, we need to choose a
step-size that will tell us how often we will change the slope that
determines the accumulation of capital (i.e. \(\dot{k}\)), we choose
different step sizes and see that the smaller the step size the closer
the solution looks to the \emph{true} solution.

Then, given the initial condition \(k(0)\), we know that
\(k(1) = k(0) + \dot{k}\). Note that we are now making two important
assumptions. We are discretizing the time space, since we are computing
values of the capital stock for certain \emph{years} (time is
continuous, not discrete, so there are no actual years) and then,
interpolate what is in between those years. Second, we are assuming a
fixed step size. Obviously, doing this by hand takes a long time, but in
a computer it takes seconds. Next figure shows the solution computed
with Euler's method and several step-sizes and a more efficient
numerical solution implemented in Python.

\subsection{Integration Techniques}\label{integration-techniques}}

\hypertarget{change-of-variables}{%
\subsubsection{Change of Variables}\label{change-of-variables}}

An important implication of the substitution property is that we can
simplify integrals significantly by applying a change of variables and
undoing it later on.

\textbf{Example:} Compute \(\int \frac{2x}{x^2+1} dx\)

This integral is not an immediate integral but note that if we let
\(z = (x^2 + 1)\), then \(dz = 2xdx\), subsituting into the integral
this change of variables, we get

\[
\int \frac{2x}{x^2+1} dx = \int \frac{1}{z} dz = \ln z + \mathcal{C}
\]

To solve the integral we must undo the change of variables

\[
\int \frac{2x}{x^2+1} dx = \ln z + \mathcal{C} = \ln\left(x^2 + 1\right) + \mathcal{C}
\]

\textbf{Example:} Compute \(\int \frac{1 - \sqrt{x}}{\sqrt[3]{x} dx\)

This is less clear than previous example, but the idea is to get rid of
the square and cubic roots, to do so, note we can substitute
\(x = y^6\), thus \(\sqrt{x} = y^3\) and \(\sqrt[3]{x} = y^2\).
Differentiating, we get \(dx = 6y^5 dy\). Subsituting into the original
integral, we need to solve now

\[
\int \frac{1 - y^3}{y^2} 6y^5 dy = \int (1 - y^3)6y^3 dy = 6 \int (y^3 - y^6) dy = 6\left(\frac{y^4}{4} - \frac{y^7}{7}\right) + \mathcal{C}
\]

    \hypertarget{integration-by-parts}{%
\subsubsection{Integration by Parts}\label{integration-by-parts}}

We stated before that integration is the inverse operation of
differentiation. From differentiation rules, we know that

\[
\frac{d}{dx}\left(f(x)g(x)\right) = f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x)
\]

Thus, we can integrate on both sides of this equation to get

\[
f(x)g(x) = \int f'(x)g(x) dx + \int f(x)g'(x) dx
\]

Which, rearranging we get

\begin{equation}
\int f(x) g'(x) dx = f(x)g(x) - \int g(x)f'(x) dx
\end{equation}

Which is the formula for \textbf{integration by parts}. The commonly
used notation is obtained by letting now \(u(x) = f(x)\) and
\(v(x) = g(x)\), then \(u'(x) = f'(x)\) and \(v'(x) = g'(x)\). By the
substitution property, previous formula becomes

\[
\int u(x)v'(x) dx = u(x)v(x) - \int v(x)u'(x)dx
\]

\textbf{Tips:} To solve an integral by parts we need to choose which
function will be \(u\) and which will be \(v\) some tips to choose these
functions are - Function \(u(x)\) must be differentiated to compute
\(u'(x)\), which does not impose any restrictions on its choice. - We
must integrate \(v'(x)\) to get \(v(x)\) thus, we want to choose
\(v'(x)\) easy enough to integrate. - Note we need to compute
\(\int v(x)u'(x)dx\) which needs to be easier to solve than
\(\int u(x)v'(x)dx\). - Typically, it is useful to choose \(u(x)\) for
polynomials or logarithms. While the choice for \(v'(x)\) is typically
exponentials or trigonometric functions. When differentiating
polynomials or logs, the resulting functions are easier while
exponential or trigonometric functions are not simplified nor
complicated after differentiating or integrating.

\textbf{Example:} Find \(\int x\sin x dx\)

Let \(u(x) = x\) and \(v'(x) = \sin x\). Then, \(u'(x) = 1\) and
\(v(x) = \int \sin x dx = -\cos x\). Thus

\[
\begin{align}
u(x) & = x \ & \ v'(x) = \sin x \\
u'(x) & = 1 \ & \ v(x) = -\cos x
\end{align}
\]

\[
\begin{align}
\int x\sin x dx & = \int u(x)v'(x)dx \\
& = u(x)v(x) - \int u'(x)v(x) dx \\
& = -x \cos x - \int (-\cos x) dx \\
& = -x\cos x + \int \cos x dx \\
& = -x \cos x + \sin x + \mathcal{C}
\end{align}
\]

\textbf{Example:} Compute \(\int \log x dx\)

Let

\[
\begin{align}
u(x) & = \log x \ & \ v'(x) = dx \\
u'(x) & = \frac{1}{x} \ & \ v(x) = x
\end{align}
\]

Using the formula for integration by parts we get

\[
\int \log x dx = x\log x - \int \frac{1}{x} x dx = x\log x - \int dx = x\log x - x + \mathcal{C}
\]

\textbf{Remark:} Note that using the formula for integrating by parts
and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we can evaluate definite
integrals by parts.

    \hypertarget{improper-integrals}{%
\subsection{Improper Integrals}\label{improper-integrals}}

When we have talked about definite integrals, we were using functions
\(f(x)\) defined on a finite interval \([a, b]\) where \(f(x)\) does not
have infinite discontinuities in that interval. We can extend the
concept of definite integrals for the case where the interval is
infinite or we have infinite discontinuities in the interval \([a, b]\).
These types of integrals are called \emph{improper} integrals, you will
see a great deal of them all over economics, econometrics,
probability\(\ldots\)

\hypertarget{type-i-infinite-intervals}{%
\subsubsection{Type I: Infinite

Consider the function \(f(x) = 1/x^2\) above the \(x-\)axis and to the

and the area we want to compute. The highlighted area can be formally
expressed as the integral

\[
A(t) = \int^t_1 \frac{1}{x^2} dx = -\frac{1}{x}\Bigg]^t_1 = 1 - \frac{1}{t}
\]

For whatever \(t\) we choose. Note that \(A(t)\) is always less than
\(1\) since \(t>1\). Further note that the limit of \(A(t)\) for
\(t\rightarrow\infty\) is equal to \(1\), so the area approaches \(1\)
as \(t\) goes to infinity. We can then write

\[
\int^{\infty}_1 \frac{1}{x^2} dx = \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\int^t_1\frac{1}{x^2} dx = 1

Suppose \(f(x)\) is a positive continuous function defined on a finite

\subsection{Definition of Sequence}\label{definition-of-sequence}}

\textbf{Definition:} A sequence of real numbers is a rule that assigns
to each natural number \(n\in \mathbb{N}\) a real number \(a_n\).

\[
\{a_n\}
\]

First term \(a_1\), second term \(a_2\),\(\ldots\), \(n-\)th term
\(a_n\). More formally, a sequence is a function that maps the natural
numbers into \(\mathbb{R}\), that is

\[
a : \mathbb{N} \mapsto \mathbb{R}, \ n \mapsto a_n
\]

\begin{align*}
& a_n = n & \ & a_1=1, a_2=2,  a_3=3,  a_4 = 4,  \ldots \\ 
& a_n = \dfrac{1}{n} & \ & a_1=1, a_2=\dfrac{1}{2},  a_3=\dfrac{1}{3},  a_4 = 
\dfrac{1}{4},  \ldots \\
& a_n= \dfrac{n+1}{n} & \ & a_1=2, a_2=\dfrac{3}{2},  a_3=\dfrac{4}{3},  a_4 = 
\dfrac{5}{4},  \ldots \\
& a_n = 2^n & \ & a_1=2, a_2=4,  a_3=8,  a_4 = 16,  \ldots \\
& a_n = \left( \dfrac{1}{3} \right)^n & \ & a_1=\dfrac{1}{3}, a_2=\dfrac{1}{9},  
a_3=\dfrac{1}{27},  a_4 = \dfrac{1}{81},  \ldots \\
& a_n = (-1)^n & \ & a_1=-1, a_2=1,  a_3=-1,  a_4 = 1,  \ldots \\
\end{align*}

\textbf{Definition:} We say a sequence \(\{a_n\}\) \textbf{converges} to
the limit \(\mathcal{L}\) if

\[
\forall \varepsilon > 0 \ \exists n_0 \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } n\geq n_0, \text{ then } \lvert a_n - \mathcal{L} \rvert < \varepsilon
\]

Which can be written as

\[
\mathcal{L} = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n
\]

\textbf{Example:} The following sequences are convergent

\begin{align*}
a_n & = \frac{1}{2^n} = \left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4},\ldots,\right) \rightarrow 0 \\
a_n & = \frac{n-1}{n+1} = \left(0,\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{4},\frac{3}{5},\frac{4}{6},\frac{5}{7},\ldots\right) \rightarrow 1
\end{align*}

The sequence
\(a_n = 2^n = \left(2,4,8,\ldots,\right) \rightarrow \infty\) is
\textbf{divergent}.

\textbf{Definition:} A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is said to be
\textbf{geometric} if the relationship between any two consecutive terms
is always constant:

\[
\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = r \ \forall n\in\mathbb{N}
\]

The constant \(r\) is called the \emph{common ratio of the geometric
sequence}. Then, any geometric sequence can be written as follows:

\[
a_0 = A, a_1 = Ar, \ldots, a_n = Ar^n, \ldots
\]

\textbf{Lemma:} A geometric sequence with common ratio \(r\) is
convergent if \(r\in (-1,1]\) and it is divergent otherwise.

\emph{Proof:} Five cases can be distinguished:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If \(r = 1\), the sequence is constant, \(a_n = A\) for every
  \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), thus its limit is \(L = A\) and the sequence is
  convergent.
\item
  If \(r = -1\) the sequence is
  \(a_1 = -A, a_2 = A, a_3 = -A, a_4 = A, \ldots\) thus it is
  oscillating between these two values and does not approach any limit.
  Thus, the sequence is divergent.
\item
  If \(-1 < r < 1\), when computing \(r^n\) a smaller number in absolute
  value is obtained each time, which becomes as small as wished. Thus,
  its limit is \(L = 0\) (regardless of the value of \(A\)) and the
  sequence is convergent.
\item
  If \(r\in (1,+\infty)\), then \(r^n\) grows and tends to \(+\infty\).
  Thus, the sequence is divergent.
\item
  If \(r\in(-\infty, -1)\), then when computing powers (even powers will
  be positive, odd ones will be negative) very large numbers are
  obtained in absolute value (as large as wished). Thus, the sequence is
  divergent.

\subsection{Definition of a Series}\label{definition-of-a-series}}

\textbf{Definition:} Let \(\{a_n\}\) be a sequence of real numbers.
Then, the associated \textbf{series} is defined as the ordered formal
sum

\[
\sum^{\infty}_{n=1} a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots
\]

\textbf{Definition:} The sequence of \textbf{partial sums} associated to
the series \(\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_n\) is defined as

\[
S_n = \sum^n_{i=1} a_i \text{ for } n\in\mathbb{N}
\]

The series converges to a limit \(\mathcal{S}\) if the sequence \(S_n\)
converges to \(S\), i.e.

\[
S = \sum^{\infty}_{i=1} a_i \text{ if and only if } S = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} S_n = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum^n_{i=1} a_i
\]

Otherwise, it is called \textbf{divergent}.

    To see whether a series is convergent or not, we state and prove a
\textbf{necessary} (not sufficient) condition for convergence of a
series.

\textbf{Theorem:} If the series \(\sum^{\infty}_{n=1} a_n\) is
convergent, then \(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_n = 0\).

\emph{Proof:} It is sufficient to note that

\[
a_n = S_{n} - S_{n-1}
\]

Since

\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}S_{n} = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}S_{n-1} = S \Rightarrow \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_{n} = S - S = 0
\]

\textbf{Example:} The sequence \(a_n = \dfrac{1}{n}\) is convergent,
since \(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \dfrac{1}{n} = 0\). However, the
series

\[
\sum^{\infty}_{i=n} \frac{1}{n}
\]

is divergent.

We have seen that the geometric sequence converges if and only if
\(\lvert r \rvert <1\), it turns out that the same holds true for the
associated geometric series.

\textbf{Theorem:} The \emph{geometric series} converges if and only if
\(\lvert r\rvert < 1\) and

\[
A\sum^{\infty}_{n=0} r^n = A\frac{1}{1-r}
\]

\emph{Proof:} Note that

\begin{align*}
S_n(1-r) = S_n - rS_n &= A\sum^n_{k=0}r^k - Ar\sum^{n}_{k=0} r^k = A\left(\sum^n_{k=0} r^k - \sum^n_{k=0} r^{k+1}\right) \\
&= A\left(\sum_{k=0}^n r^k - \sum^{n+1}_{k=1} r^k\right) =A\left( r^0 - r^{n+1}\right) = A\left(1-r^{n+1}\right)
\end{align*}

Thus,

\[
S_n = \frac{A\left(1-r^{n+1}\right)}{1-r}
\]

Now, computing the limit of \(S_n\), we can see

\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} S_n = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{A\left(1-r^{n+1}\right)}{1-r} = \frac{A\left(1 -  \displaystyle\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} r^{n+1}\right)}{1-r} =  \frac{A}{1-r} \text{ if and only if }\lvert r \rvert < 1
\]

    \hypertarget{taylor-expansion}{%
\subsection{Taylor Expansion}\label{taylor-expansion}}

A very useful series used \textbf{a lot} in macroeconomics (wait until
you see a log-linearization of a DSGE model) is the Taylor Expansion.
Let us define it now.

\textbf{Definition:} The \textbf{Taylor polynomial} of order \(n\) of a
function \(f(x)\) which is \(n\) times differentiable around a point
\(x = a\) is given by

\[
P_n\left(f,a\right) = f(a) + \frac{1}{1!}f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{1}{2!} f''(a)(x-a)^2+\ldots+\frac{1}{n!}f^{(n)}(a)(x-a)^n
\]

When \(a = 0\), it is called \textbf{McLaurin Polynomial}.

When the Taylor expansion is for \(n\rightarrow\infty\) a power series
arises as

\[
S\left(f,a\right) = f(a) + \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \frac{1}{n!}f^{(n)}(a)(x-a)^n
\]

The following theorem tells us that the Taylor expansion of any
infinite-times differentiable function coincides with the actual value
of the function around that point. Thus, an n-degree approximation of a
function can be a very good approximation.

\textbf{Theorem:} If the derivatives of any order of a function \(f(x)\)
exist in a point \(x = a\), then

\[
f(x) = f(a) + \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \frac{1}{n!}f^{(n)}(a)(x-a)^n \ \forall x\in(a-\delta,a+\delta)
\]

Where \(\delta>0\) but small.
