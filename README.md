# Mathematics Camp

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks, PDFs, and TeX files for the math-camp notes. They are basically compilations of three main different sources (probably more). The ones I've used the most are:

- [QuantEcon](https://python.quantecon.org/)
- [Simon and Blume's Mathematics for Economists](https://www.amazon.es/Mathematics-Economists-Carl-P-Simon/dp/0393957330)
- [Stewart's Calculus](https://www.amazon.es/Calculus-James-Stewart/dp/0538497815)
